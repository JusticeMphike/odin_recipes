        <li>Layer lamb in the bottom of the large pot. Arrange eggplant, zucchini, broccoli, and cauliflower on top of the in layers. Pour rice over meat and vegetables, shaking the pot gently to allow rice to settle into the dish. Por reserved cooking liquid from lamb over the mixture until it is completely covered. Adfd water if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and simmer over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the lid from the pot. Place a large platter over the pot and flip the pot so the dish is "upside down" on the platter. Serve with yogurt on the side.</li>
