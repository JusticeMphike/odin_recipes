    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For everyone who likes a thick, heavier dumpling, not the fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth kind from a can, this recipe is for YOU!! These are very easy to make, and taste the way you remember your Grandma's dumplings! They're also great in a chicken and dumplings recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1(.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>(32 ounce) carton chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place milk and butter in a small saucepan, and simmer over medium heat until butter melts. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the yeast in the warm water placed in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl, and mix until thoroughly blended. Gradually stir in the flour, alternating with milk and yeast mixture. Gather the dough into a ball. Cover the bowl with a cloth, and let the dough rest 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken broth into a large pot. Bring broth to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sprinkle flour over a clean board or countertop. Turn the dough out onto the board and knead lightly until smooth and satiny, about 3 minutes. Add a little more flour if the dough is sticky. Roll out the dough to be about 1/2 inch thick. Use a butter knife to cut dough into 2 inch wide strips, and place strips into the boiling broth. Dumplings will initially sink, then rise to the surface when cooked, about 10 minutes. Remove dumplings from the broth with a slotted spoon, and drain on a plate.</li>
    </ol>
